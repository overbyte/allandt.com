Managed freelance development to create supporting backend PostgREST state machine and registration application for
MLBAM VR Game. The backend was designed to allow guests to sign up to play the VR Game and would send SMS text messages
to welcome, recall and finally deliver a souvenir combining the guest's photo (taken at registration) and their score
from the game.

I also worked with the MLBAM Team to deliver a custom version of the software to hook into the backend state machine
to trigger LED effects in the cage, providing idle, in-game, homerun, miss and game over states to increase excitement
for the people watching.

The cage was rolled out to Pop Brixton for 2 nights and the 2017 BST event in Regent's Park.
