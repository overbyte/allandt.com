Created a 3D model viewer with pre-rendered slideshow of angles of the Landrover Defender.

Using a swipe gesture, the user would be taken to the nearest hotspot if they were within
a tolerance. A tap on a hotspot would zoom in, play an animation to highlight the focus
and allow the user to show a before and after of the recent design updates to the model.
